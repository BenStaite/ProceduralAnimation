# Unity Procedural Animation
Procedurally animated humanoids using unities IK system
 
 The alien will follow the red ball (Target) with procedurally calculated animation
 
 A player prefab can also be found and added to the scene which uses inverse kinematics similiar to that of the alien, blended with pre-baked animations.
